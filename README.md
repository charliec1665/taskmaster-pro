# Taskmaster Pro

## Description

Taskmaster Pro is a task tracking application written in JavaScript and incorporates third-party libraries jQuery and Bootstrap. Taskmaster comes from legacy code which was updated and modified to allow editing of tasks, adds drag and drop capabilities, adds a calendar date-picker for task due dates, and adds periodic checks to determine if tasks are overdue.
